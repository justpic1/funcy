# functional_spreadsheet
A new Flutter project. I created this sproject in my 12th grade PLTW Engineering Design and Development class. It was a 4 week project, where we were taught the steps to engineering a solution to a problem. In this program I decided to merge a node system (think Blender's for inspiration) with a spreadsheet. This would visualize the function tree created in the spreadsheet so that less mistakes are made and the sheet is more readable. I did not finish the project, and with school continuing, and the big project starting soon, this may be on the shelf for quite some time. I hope anybody who comes across this enjoys it.
